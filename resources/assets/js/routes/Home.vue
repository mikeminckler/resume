            <p>As a full-stack designer since 2005, with expertise in HTML & CSS, my projects include front-end development work for BlueHealth Inc, Brentwood College School, and clients blah blah blah. My career has been an eclectic blend of video production, photography, graphic design, and 3D animation. I'm deeply interested in frontend web design and the user experience. I'm always challenging myself to tackle new projects. The question is never <span style="font-style: italic">Can I</span>, but rather <span style="font-style: italic;">How do I</span>.</p>
