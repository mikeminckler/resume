    <div class="route">

        <p>Since 2005 a professional web developer and content creator in the areas of  <router-link to="web-development" class="route-link">web design</router-link>, video production, photography, graphic design, and 3D animation. An adaptive life-long learner always improving and staying current with the latest in progressive technology and digital media.</p>

        <p>As a full-stack designer since 2005, with expertise in HTML & CSS, my projects include front-end development work for BlueHealth Inc, Brentwood College School, and clients blah blah blah. My career has been an eclectic blend of video production, photography, graphic design, and 3D animation. I'm deeply interested in frontend web design and the user experience. I'm always challenging myself to tackle new projects. The question is never <span style="font-style: italic">Can I</span>, but rather <span style="font-style: italic;">How do I</span>.</p>

        <p>You will probably notice that many things I do in my professional career are also mirror in the side projects where I develop new skills and explore new ways of creating digital and online content.</p>

        <p>Soccer volleyball coach. Music. Travel</p>

        <p>Everything on this resume, unless otherwise stated, is my creation. I'm am capable of starting at design and moving right through to launch. Design, Web, Video, Photo.</p>
